}
\arguments{
\item{box.padding}{Amount of padding around bounding box, as unit or number.
Defaults to 0.25. (Default unit is lines, but other units can be specified
by passing \code{unit(x, "units")}).}

\item{point.padding}{Amount of padding around labeled point, as unit or
number. Defaults to 0. (Default unit is lines, but other units can be
specified by passing \code{unit(x, "units")}).}

\item{min.segment.length}{Skip drawing segments shorter than this, as unit or
number. Defaults to 0.5. (Default unit is lines, but other units can be
specified by passing \code{unit(x, "units")}).}

\item{arrow}{specification for arrow heads, as created by
\code{\link[grid]{arrow}}}

\item{force}{Force of repulsion between overlapping glyphs. Defaults to
1.}

\item{force_pull}{Force of attraction between a glyph and its
corresponding data point. Defaults to 1.}

\item{max.time}{Maximum number of seconds to try to resolve overlaps.
Defaults to 0.5.}

\item{max.iter}{Maximum number of iterations to try to resolve overlaps.
Defaults to 10000.}

\item{max.overlaps}{Exclude glyphs that overlap too many things.
Defaults to 10.}

\item{nudge_x, nudge_y}{Horizontal and vertical adjustments to nudge the
starting position of each glyph. The units for \code{nudge_x} and
\code{nudge_y} are the same as for the data units on the x-axis and y-axis.}

\item{xlim, ylim}{Limits for the x and y axes. Glyphs will be constrained
to these limits. By default, glyphs are constrained to the entire plot
area.}

\item{direction}{"both", "x", or "y" -- direction in which to adjust position
of labels}

\item{seed}{Random seed passed to \code{\link[base]{set.seed}}. Defaults to
\code{NA}, which means that \code{set.seed} will not be called.}

\item{verbose}{If \code{TRUE}, some diagnostics of the repel algorithm are
printed}
}

other.
